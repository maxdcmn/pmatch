The collective behavior of the elements of these networks is organized according to community structure. Several methods have been defined to automatically detect these substructures in the field known as community discovery. Most of the methods have been applied to static or aggregated data. Recently the identification of evolving communities has gained more attention. Studying the relations among individuals yields insights on how communities form and evolve, but there are some limits that should be enforced to respect individuals’ privacy while sharing and collecting their data. Privacy-protection techniques have been commonly applied to static data, while there are few methods that work on d...', 'Federated Learning ( FL ) has emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm that allows multiple users to collaboratively train a model without sharing their data thus preserving privacy. Within the scope of privacy preservation, information privacy regulations such as GDPR entitle users to request the removal (or unlearning) of their contribution from a service that is hosting the model. For this purpose, a server hosting an ML model must be able to unlearn certain information in cases such as copyright infringement or security issues that can make the model vulnerable or impact the performance of a service based on that model. While most unlearning approaches in FL focus on Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), where clients share the feature space and the global model, Vertical Fe...', 'Machine Unlearning allows participants to remove their data from a trained machine learning model in order to preserve their privacy, and security. However, the machine unlearning literature for generative models is rather limited. The literature for image-to-image generative model (I2I model) considers minimizing the distance between Gaussian noise and the output of I2I model for forget samples as machine unlearning. However, we argue that the machine learning model performs fairly well on unseen data i.e., a retrained model will be able to catch generic patterns in the data and hence will not generate an output which is equivalent to Gaussian noise.

Hence, there is a need to leverage the knowledge of disease pathogenesis and treatment from the wider disease landscape to understand rare disease mechanisms. Furthermore, it is well understood that rare disease discoveries can inform the our knowledge of common diseases. In this paper, we introduce Dis2Vec (Disease to Vector), a new representation learning method for characterizing diseases with a focus on learning the underlying biological mechanisms, which is a step toward developing a foundation model for disease-association learning. Dis2Vec is trained on human genetic evidence and observed symptoms, and then evaluated through cross-modal transfer-lear...', 'Gold nanoparticles are used in a range of applications, but their properties depend on their shape, size, and polydispersity. A quick, easy, and accurate characterization of the particles is therefore of high importance, especially in flow synthesis settings where continuous monitoring of the characteristics is desired. Our hypothesis was that convolutional neural networks can be used to extract detailed information about structural parameters of gold nanoparticles from their UV–vis spectra, and we have shown that this is possible by predicting size distributions from in silico UV–vis spectra for colloidal gold with high accuracy. Here this was done for both spherical and rod-shaped gold nanoparticles. We also show that the addition of noise makes the prediction of diameter polydispersity ...', 'ABSTRACT Machine learning applications for the drug discovery pipeline have exponentially increased in the last few years. An example of these applications is the biological Knowledge Graph. These graphs represent biological entities and the relations between them based on existing knowledge. Graph machine learning models such as Graph Neural Networks can be applied on top of knowledge graphs to support the development of novel therapeutics. Nevertheless, Graph Neural Networks present an improved performance at the expense of complexity, becoming difficult to explain their decisions. State-of-the-art explanation algorithms for Graph Neural Networks focus on determining the most relevant subgraphs involved in their decision-making while considering graph elements (nodes and edges) as indepe...'], 'score': 0.4461648591457177}
