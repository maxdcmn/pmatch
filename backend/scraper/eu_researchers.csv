Kidney dysfunction occurs at very low exposures and is often considered as the most sensitive or critical effect. Cadmium exposures of concern occur in many countries. In low- and middle-income countries with small-scale mining, excessive exposure to cadmium and other metals occurs in occupational and environmental settings. This is of particular importance in view of the growing demand for metals in global climate change mitigation.

Here, we employ supercomoving coordinates to study the magnetic field amplification from decaying turbulence during gravitational collapse. We perform 3D simulations and show that for large magnetic Reynolds numbers, there can be exponential growth of the comoving magnetic field with conformal time before the decay of turbulence impedes further amplification. The collapse dynamics only affect the nonlinear feedback from the Lorentz force, which diminishes more rapidly for shorter collapse times, allowing nearly kinematic continued growth. We confirm that helical turbulence is more efficient in driving dynamo action than nonhelical turbulence, but thi..."", ""Powerful lasers may be used in the future to produce magnetic fields that would allow us to study turbulent magnetohydrodynamic inverse cascade behaviour. This has so far only been seen in numerical simulations. In the laboratory, however, the produced fields may be highly anisotropic.

As a consequence, we find the decay dynamics to be similar to that in isotropic turbulence. We also find that an initially pointwise non-helical magnetic field is unstable and develops magnetic helicity fluctuations that can be quantified by the Hosking integral. It is a conserved quantity that characterises magnetic helicity fluctuations and governs the turbulent d..."", ""Abstract Kinetic helicity is a fundamental characteristic of astrophysical turbulent flows. It is not only responsible for the generation of large-scale magnetic fields in the Sun, stars, and spiral galaxies, but it also affects turbulent diffusion, resulting in the dissipation of large-scale magnetic fields. Using the path integral approach for random helical velocity fields with a finite correlation time and large Reynolds numbers, we show that turbulent magnetic diffusion is reduced by the kinetic helicity, while the turbulent diffusivity of a passive scalar is enhanced by the helicity. The latter can explain the results of recent numerical simulations for forced helical turbulence.

The flux of these components is expected to vary with the 11 yr solar cycle, being highest during solar minimum and lowest during solar maximum, as it varies with the cosmic-ray flux. No study has yet analyzed the flux variation of each component over solar cycles. In this work, we measure the temporal variations of the flux of each component over 15 yr of Fermi Large Area Telescope observations and compare them with the sunspot number and Galactic cosmic-ray flux from AMS-02 near Earth. We find that the flux ..."", ""Institutionen för akvatiska resurser (SLU Aqua) har på uppdrag av Havs- och vattenmyndigheten, utformat en indikator, Hållbart nyttjande av fisk- och skaldjursbestånd i kust och hav, för uppföljning av miljökvalitetsmålet ”Hav i balans samt levande kust och skärgård”. Indikatorn visar den övergripande statusen för svenska fisk- och skaldjursbestånd längs kusterna och i haven, och baseras på de årliga analyserna av enskilda fiskbestånds status i rapporten ”Fisk- och skaldjursbestånd i hav och sötvatten”, vilken redovisas på webbportalen (SLU Aqua 2025). Indikatorn anger om bestånden fiskas hållbart eller ej, vilket i och med denna rapport nu har gjorts för åren 2015-2024. I denna rapport presenteras en bedömning av indikatorns status för bedömningsåret 2024 med data till och med 2023.

After 15 years of Fermi sky-survey observations, doubling the total time range, we report >7 cycle gamma-ray modulation with an estimated significance of 4 sigma against stochastic red noise. Independent determinations of oscillation period and phase in the earlier and the new data are in close agreement (chance probability <0.01). Pulse timing over the full light curve is also consistent with a coherent periodicity.

Also, they are essential for didactic purposes in the field of radiation research. Professional dosemeters are expensive and difficult to use in exposure facilities with closed exposure chambers. Consequently, a simple, inexpensive, battery-driven dosemeter was developed that can be easily built using readily available components. Measurements were performed to validate its readout with photons of different energy and dose rate and to demonstrate the applicability of the dosemeter. It turned out that the accuracy of the dose measurements using the developed dosemeter was better than 10%, which is satisfact..."", ""The European Spallation Source, currently under construction in Lund, Sweden, is a multidisciplinary international laboratory. Once completed to full specifications, it will operate the world’s most powerful pulsed neutron source. Supported by a 3 million Euro Research and Innovation Action within the EU Horizon 2020 program, a design study (HighNESS) has been completed to develop a second neutron source located below the spallation target. Compared to the first source, designed for high cold and thermal brightness, the new source has been optimized to deliver higher intensity, and a shift to longer wavelengths in the spectral regions of cold (CN, 2–20 Å), very cold (VCN, 10–120 Å), and ultracold (UCN, >500 Å) neutrons. The second source comprises a large liquid deuterium moderator designe..."", ""A key aim of the HighNESS project for the European Spallation Source is to enable cutting-edge particle physics experiments. This volume presents a conceptual design report for the NNBAR experiment. NNBAR would exploit a new cold lower moderator to make the first search in over thirty years for free neutrons converting to anti-neutrons. The observation of such a baryon-number-violating signature would be of fundamental significance and tackle open questions in modern physics, including the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry. This report shows the design of the beamline, supermirror focusing system, magnetic and radiation shielding, and anti-neutron detector necessary for the experiment. A range of simulation programs are employed to quantify the performance of the experiment and sho...""]"

The ALDH1A subfamily has largely been associated with elevated expression in cancer tissues, and in particular in cancer stem-like cells ALDH1A1 is a frequently expressed enzyme in stem cells and target for therapeutic intervention, however, other isoforms such as 1A2, 1A3, 2, 3A1 and 7A1 have drawn significant attention in the recent years due to their involvement in various pathophysiological conditions.

A promising strategy for developing effective anti-obesity agents is to inhibit pancreatic lipase, thereby reducing lipid absorption. Currently, the only clinically approved pharmacological agent for pancreatic lipase inhibition is Orlistat. However, its undesirable gastrointestinal side effects have prompted the search for more effective and potent drugs. This study investigates the inhibitory mechanism of Bromhexine, a mucolytic drug, on pancreatic lipase using Lineweaver–Burk plot analysis and molecular docking, along with simulations, and compares its efficacy to that of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug..."", ""Lung cancer is the leading cause of death by cancer in the world and finding new targets is a major medical need to tackle this disease. Here, upon proteomic analysis to identify common players in oncogenic EGFR- and KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma mouse models, we uncovered a largely unknown protein in cancer, flavin-containing monooxygenase 4 (FMO4), whose expression was increased in lung tumors compared with adjacent lung tissue. FMO4 expression was strongly increased also in lung cancer samples from patients compared with healthy lung, and its expression level was inversely correlated with overall survival. Remarkably, in vivo deletion of FMO4 greatly decreased tumor burden and increased survival in oncogenic KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma mice unveiling its crucial role in tumor biol...""]"
