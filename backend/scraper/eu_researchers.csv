"Monica Nordberg","","Professor","Karolinska Institutet","SE","Computer Science","https://openalex.org/A5006834808","Cadmium is widely recognized as an important environmental toxicant that may give rise to kidney dysfunction, bone disease, and cancer in humans and animals. Kidney dysfunction occurs at very low exposures and is often considered as the most sensitive or critical effect. Cadmium exposures of concern occur in many countries. In low- and middle-income countries with small-scale mining, excessive exposure to cadmium and other metals occurs in occupational and environmental settings. This is of particular importance in view of the growing demand for metals in global climate change mitigation. Since the 1970s, the present authors have contributed evidence concerning the role of metallothionein and other factors in influencing the toxicokinetics and toxicity of cadmium, particularly as it relate... | Biomarkers or biological indicators of metal-induced renal toxicity have been employed for several decades in monitoring the early clinical effects of nephrotoxic metals such as lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and mercury (Hg). These indicators, which are early biochemical tests for assessing the biochemical responses of the kidney to these metals prior to overt clinical disease, have proven useful for indicating not only metal exposure, but that a sufficient quantity of a given metal is biologically available to produce a cellular response. In order to be really useful, a good biomarker must be highly sensitive, easily measurable, relatively chemical-specific, and interpretable as to whether it is an index of exposure or toxic effect. A major research need is to provide correlative morphological... | More than one and a half centuries ago, adverse human health effects were reported after use of a cadmium-containing silver polishing agent. Long-term cadmium exposure gives rise to kidney or bone disease, reproductive toxicity and cancer in animals and humans. At present, high human exposures to cadmium occur in small-scale mining, underlining the need for preventive measures. This is particularly urgent in view of the growing demand for minerals and metals in global climate change mitigation. This review deals with a specific part of cadmium toxicology that is important for understanding when toxic effects appear and, thus, is crucial for risk assessment.

Acute pain resulting from an acute event is a fundamental condition for survival, insofar as it warns against imminent or actual tissue damage, a potentially life-endangering threat. The importance of the physiological, protective role of nociceptive pain is underscored by cases, in which a failure to sense pain such as in the case of congenital insensitivity often leads to self-mutilation, bone fractures, joint deformities, amputations, and even early death. While the goal of acute pain based on nociception thus appears to be clear, its implementation is anything but that because to achieve this goal calls for a number of requirements to be fulfilled.

The approach exploits multiple bound states in the continuum (BICs) supported by the PhC slab, which serve as polarization vortex center in momentum space.

Unlike conventional spiral phase plates, our design scheme is composed of double-layer periodic units and without a distinct optical geometric center. This PhC slab exhibits insensitivity to the position of the incident wave and is conducive to the flexible configuration of the OAM generator. We further investigate a compact OAM antenna system based on the proposed PhC slab lens.

By leveraging multi-dimensional histograms with precise arithmetic and utilizing the SparkDensityTree library, it is possible to identify high-density regions within the available phase space, potentially improving sensitivity to very small signals. Inspired by a search for dark mesons at the ATLAS experiment, CMS open data is used for this proof-of-concept intentionally targeting an already excluded signal. Signal regions are defined based on density estimates of signal and background. These preliminary regions align well with the physical properties of the signal while effectively rejecting background events."

We perform 3D simulations and show that for large magnetic Reynolds numbers, there can be exponential growth of the comoving magnetic field with conformal time before the decay of turbulence impedes further amplification. The collapse dynamics only affect the nonlinear feedback from the Lorentz force, which diminishes more rapidly for shorter collapse times, allowing nearly kinematic continued growth.

This has so far only been seen in numerical simulations. In the laboratory, however, the produced fields may be highly anisotropic. Here, we present corresponding simulations to show that, during the turbulent decay, such a magnetic field undergoes spontaneous isotropisation. As a consequence, we find the decay dynamics to be similar to that in isotropic turbulence. We also find that an initially pointwise non-helical magnetic field is unstable and develops magnetic helicity fluctuations that can be quantified by the Hosking integral. It is a conserved quantity that characterises magnetic helicity fluctuations and governs the turbulent d... | Abstract Kinetic helicity is a fundamental characteristic of astrophysical turbulent flows. It is not only responsible for the generation of large-scale magnetic fields in the Sun, stars, and spiral galaxies, but it also affects turbulent diffusion, resulting in the dissipation of large-scale magnetic fields. Using the path integral approach for random helical velocity fields with a finite correlation time and large Reynolds numbers, we show that turbulent magnetic diffusion is reduced by the kinetic helicity, while the turbulent diffusivity of a passive scalar is enhanced by the helicity. The latter can explain the results of recent numerical simulations for forced helical turbulence.

In addition, injectable cryogels can be loaded with therapeutic agents or cells in tissue engineering and clinical studies. The purpose of this revi... | Microbial contaminants are responsible for several infectious diseases, and they have been introduced as important potential food- and water-borne risk factors. They become a global burden due to their health and safety threats. In addition, their tendency to undergo mutations that result in antimicrobial resistance makes them difficult to treat. In this respect, rapid and reliable detection of microbial contaminants carries great significance, and this research area is explored as a rich subject within a dynamic state. Optical sensing serving as analytical devices enables simple usage, low-cost, rapid, and sensitive detection with the advantage of their miniaturization.

For a standard trigger with a threshold signal to noise ratio at 4.4, the new cuts produce a neutrino efficiency of > 95% per station-year of operation, while rejecting 99.93% of the backgrou..."

The early interest in GEG was much preoccupied with environmental diplomacy and international legal agreements from the Stockholm UN conference 1972 onwards. The addition of the ‘global’ reflected the general rise in awareness of the significance of globalization since the 1980s. The further growth, and the transformation of GEG, in earnest since the Millennium has been increasingly marked by yet another category, ‘the planetary’, mirroring the increasing influence of Earth System Science on environmental and climate discourse. This has affected both GEG and ‘the environment’ itself. T..."

Once completed to full specifications, it will operate the world’s most powerful pulsed neutron source. Supported by a 3 million Euro Research and Innovation Action within the EU Horizon 2020 program, a design study (HighNESS) has been completed to develop a second neutron source located below the spallation target. Compared to the first source, designed for high cold and thermal brightness, the new source has been optimized to deliver higher intensity, and a shift to longer wavelengths in the spectral regions of cold (CN, 2–20 Å), very cold (VCN, 10–120 Å), and ultracold (UCN, >500 Å) neutrons. The second source comprises a large liquid deuterium moderator designe... | A key aim of the HighNESS project for the European Spallation Source is to enable cutting-edge particle physics experiments. This volume presents a conceptual design report for the NNBAR experiment. NNBAR would exploit a new cold lower moderator to make the first search in over thirty years for free neutrons converting to anti-neutrons. The observation of such a baryon-number-violating signature would be of fundamental significance and tackle open questions in modern physics, including the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry.

A range of simulation programs are employed to quantify the performance of the experiment and sho... | Tests of the T, CP and CPT symmetries in the neutral kaon system are performed by the direct comparison of the probabilities of a kaon transition process to its symmetry-conjugate. The exchange of in and out states required for a genuine test involving an antiunitary transformation implied by time-reversal is implemented exploiting the entanglement of K0K‾0 pairs produced at a ϕ-factory. A data sample collected by the KLOE experiment at DAΦNE corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 1.7 fb−1 is analysed to study the Δt distributions of the ϕ→KSKL→π+π−π±e∓ν and ϕ→KSKL→π±e∓ν3π0 processes, with Δt the difference of the kaon decay times. A comparison of the measured Δt distributions in the asymptotic region Δt≫τS allows to test for the first time T and CPT symmetries in kaon transiti..."

A quick, easy, and accurate characterization of the particles is therefore of high importance, especially in flow synthesis settings where continuous monitoring of the characteristics is desired. Our hypothesis was that convolutional neural networks can be used to extract detailed information about structural parameters of gold nanoparticles from their UV–vis spectra, and we have shown that this is possible by predicting size distributions from in silico UV–vis spectra for colloidal gold with high accuracy. Here this was done for both spherical and rod-shaped gold nanoparticles. We also show that the addition of noise makes the prediction of diameter polydispersity ... | ABSTRACT Machine learning applications for the drug discovery pipeline have exponentially increased in the last few years. An example of these applications is the biological Knowledge Graph. These graphs represent biological entities and the relations between them based on existing knowledge. Graph machine learning models such as Graph Neural Networks can be applied on top of knowledge graphs to support the development of novel therapeutics. Nevertheless, Graph Neural Networks present an improved performance at the expense of complexity, becoming difficult to explain their decisions. State-of-the-art explanation algorithms for Graph Neural Networks focus on determining the most relevant subgraphs involved in their decision-making while considering graph elements (nodes and edges) as indepe..."

The main objective of this work was to investigate the processability, compatibility, and recyclability of lignin blends with poly(lactic acid). Two different commercial kraft lignins and a phenolated organosolv lignin were blended with poly(lactic acid) at various weight percentages, targeting high lignin content (30, 50, and 70 wt %). Obtained blends were used in additive manufacturing via fused deposition modeling. All obtained materials were thoroughly characterized by tensile tests, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and 31P NMR. The recyclability of the polymer blend materials was evaluated by re-extruding them up to four times, and their printab..."

A heavy, moving target instrumented with nuclear emulsion films followed by a silicon pixel tracker was installed in front of the Goliath magnet at the H4 proton beamline. Behind the magnet, scintillating-fibre, drift-tube and RPC detectors were placed. The purpose of this run was to validate the measurement's feasibility, to develop the required analysis tools and fine-tune the detector layout. In this paper, we present the track reconstruction in the pixel tracker and the track matching with the moving emulsion detector. The pixel detector performed as expected and it is shown that, after proper alignment, a vertex matching rate of 87 % is achieved. | Abstract The operation at the Z-pole of the FCC-ee machine will deliver the highest possible instantaneous luminosities with the goal of collecting the largest Z boson datasets (Tera-Z), and enable a programme of standard model physics studies with unprecedented precision.
