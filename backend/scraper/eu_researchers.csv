"Monica Nordberg","","Professor","Karolinska Institutet","SE","Computer Science","https://openalex.org/A5006834808","[""Cadmium is widely recognized as an important environmental toxicant that may give rise to kidney dysfunction, bone disease, and cancer in humans and animals. Kidney dysfunction occurs at very low exposures and is often considered as the most sensitive or critical effect. Cadmium exposures of concern occur in many countries. In low- and middle-income countries with small-scale mining, excessive exposure to cadmium and other metals occurs in occupational and environmental settings. This is of particular importance in view of the growing demand for metals in global climate change mitigation. Since the 1970s, the present authors have contributed evidence concerning the role of metallothionein and other factors in influencing the toxicokinetics and toxicity of cadmium, particularly as it relate..."", ""Biomarkers or biological indicators of metal-induced renal toxicity have been employed for several decades in monitoring the early clinical effects of nephrotoxic metals such as lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and mercury (Hg). These indicators, which are early biochemical tests for assessing the biochemical responses of the kidney to these metals prior to overt clinical disease, have proven useful for indicating not only metal exposure, but that a sufficient quantity of a given metal is biologically available to produce a cellular response. In order to be really useful, a good biomarker must be highly sensitive, easily measurable, relatively chemical-specific, and interpretable as to whether it is an index of exposure or toxic effect. A major research need is to provide correlative morphological..."", ""More than one and a half centuries ago, adverse human health effects were reported after use of a cadmium-containing silver polishing agent. Long-term cadmium exposure gives rise to kidney or bone disease, reproductive toxicity and cancer in animals and humans. At present, high human exposures to cadmium occur in small-scale mining, underlining the need for preventive measures. This is particularly urgent in view of the growing demand for minerals and metals in global climate change mitigation. This review deals with a specific part of cadmium toxicology that is important for understanding when toxic effects appear and, thus, is crucial for risk assessment.

Here, we employ supercomoving coordinates to study the magnetic field amplification from decaying turbulence during gravitational collapse. We perform 3D simulations and show that for large magnetic Reynolds numbers, there can be exponential growth of the comoving magnetic field with conformal time before the decay of turbulence impedes further amplification. The collapse dynamics only affect the nonlinear feedback from the Lorentz force, which diminishes more rapidly for shorter collapse times, allowing nearly kinematic continued growth. We confirm that helical turbulence is more efficient in driving dynamo action than nonhelical turbulence, but thi..."", ""Powerful lasers may be used in the future to produce magnetic fields that would allow us to study turbulent magnetohydrodynamic inverse cascade behaviour. This has so far only been seen in numerical simulations. In the laboratory, however, the produced fields may be highly anisotropic. Here, we present corresponding simulations to show that, during the turbulent decay, such a magnetic field undergoes spontaneous isotropisation. As a consequence, we find the decay dynamics to be similar to that in isotropic turbulence. We also find that an initially pointwise non-helical magnetic field is unstable and develops magnetic helicity fluctuations that can be quantified by the Hosking integral. It is a conserved quantity that characterises magnetic helicity fluctuations and governs the turbulent d..."", ""Abstract Kinetic helicity is a fundamental characteristic of astrophysical turbulent flows. It is not only responsible for the generation of large-scale magnetic fields in the Sun, stars, and spiral galaxies, but it also affects turbulent diffusion, resulting in the dissipation of large-scale magnetic fields. Using the path integral approach for random helical velocity fields with a finite correlation time and large Reynolds numbers, we show that turbulent magnetic diffusion is reduced by the kinetic helicity, while the turbulent diffusivity of a passive scalar is enhanced by the helicity. The latter can explain the results of recent numerical simulations for forced helical turbulence.

Typical tasks include mathematical modeling, analysis, simulation, design and implementation. The ability to solve these problems rests heavily on a number of concepts such as feedback, stability and robustness. Since dynamics is a key feature, it is necessary for a control engineer to have a very good understanding of dynamical systems, and that he or she be able to consider such systems from many different views. To instantiate a design, it is necessary to have a good understanding of and insight into trade-offs and compromises."", ""We present a trajectory tracking controller for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) configured on $SU(2)\\times R^3$, and relate this result to a family of geometric tracking controllers on $SO(3)\\times R^3$. The theoretical results are complemented by simulation examples, and the controller is subsequently implemented in practice and integrated with a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system through an extended Kalman filter (EKF). This facilitates the operation of the UAV without external motion capture systems, and we demonstrate that the proposed control system can be used for inventorying tasks in a supermarket environment without external positioning systems."", ""Automatic tuning of PID controllers using relay feedback experiments has received attention on and off since it was first proposed and industrially implemented in a control system in the 1980s.

Here we present a combination of experiment and subsequent output-error identification of continuous-time first-order time-delayed (FOTD) system models, that requires very little in terms of computations and memory. The method has been extensively evaluated in simulation, and a prototype has been implemented for the ABB AC 800M controller family.""]"

The HGCAL is a sampling calorimeter with very fine transverse and longitudinal granularity. The active media are silicon sensors and scintillator tiles readout by SiPMs and the absorbers are a combination of lead and Cu/CuW in the electromagnetic section, and steel in the hadronic section. The shower reconstruction method is based on graph neural networks and it makes use of a dynamic reduction network architecture. It is shown that the algorithm is able to capture and mitigate the main effects that normally hinder the reconstruction of hadronic showers using classical reconstruction methods, by compensating for fluctuations in the multiplicity, energy, and sp...""]"

The source’s X-ray flux within this phase interval seems to have exhibited a significant change on an orbital timescale. Additionally, occasional short-term variations in the X-ray band on a timescale of less than 3 days have been observed.

One common explanation is that weak intergalactic magnetic fields deflect the electron–positron pairs away from our line of sight. An alternative possibility is that electrostatic beam-plasma instabilities drain the energy of these pairs before a cascade can develop. Recent studies have shown that beam scattering by oblique electrostatic modes leads to minimal energy loss. But these modes might be suppressed by linear Landau damping (LLD) due to MeV-scale cosmic-ray electrons in the IGM.

Predictions are compared to the data from Monte Carlo simulations of the Lebwohl–Lasher model on L × L × L simple cubic lattices. The data show that the intersection of the fourth-order cumulant of the order parameter for different lattice sizes can be expressed in terms of the relative degeneracy q = 4π of the ordered and disordered phases.

This method allows to deposit the maximum dose to the tumor and minimize the damage to healthy tissue, due to the Bragg peak of the ion energy deposition near the end of the particle range. During the treatment, it is possible to provide volumetric dose delivery by changing the particle energy (penetration depth) and adjusting the beam position via a magnetic system. For the beam monitoring system, the precise measurement of the beam direction, shape and fluence in real time becomes crucial to provide effective and safe dose delivery to the tumor.
