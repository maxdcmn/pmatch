    "the SVD and outline applications that show why this decomposition is worth computing \n",
    "and investing time into. The central part of this thesis will then be numerical algorithms \n",
    "for computation of the SVD and numerical testing of them. The implemented versions of the \n",

    "the Golub-Reinsch algorithm, Gu and Eisenstat's Divide-And-Conquer algorithm and the preconditioned, \n",
